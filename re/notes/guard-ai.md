# Guard AI (Gurlukovich soldiers)

Addresses are in the w00a resident code image (loaded at `0x1F1480`, see
`stage-dat.md`). The port is `crates/tanker/src/guard.rs`.

## Actors

| Actor | Role |
|---|---|
| `chara 0xf7f777` | soldier: `-r` route, `-n` first route point, `-d x y z` start, `-i d0 d1 d2` vision, `-l` (hearing?), `-f` |
| `chara 0xddf5ca` | enemy manager: phases; `-h` caution time (default 0xE10); `-w proc` creates "wccomm" |
| `chara 0x59eda8` | "wccomm": `-e proc` creates the soldiers |

The soldier's act function is `FUN_00223388`; its controller lives at
guard+0x24d0.

`-i` comes from variables As16:0x1bc/0x1be/0x1c0, which the title screen
(`n_title` main, first statement) sets per difficulty:

| Difficulty (Bs16:0x8) | 0x1bc | 0x1be | 0x1c0 | 0x1c4 | 0x1c6 | life (Bs16:0xf4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 Very Easy | 4000 | 7500 | 5000 | 3000 | 3 | 200 |
| 20 Easy | 4000 | 9000 | 6000 | 3000 | 5 | 150 |
| 30 Normal | 6000 | 9000 | 6000 | 3000 | 9 | 100 |
| 40 Hard | 7000 | 12000 | 8000 | 4000 | 14 | 75 |
| 50 Extreme | 7000 | 12000 | 8000 | 6000 | 19 | 50 |

## Perception: `FUN_002559C0`

- near range d (controller +0x248), far range 1.5d;
- horizontal: ±0x200 (of 4096) around the head yaw; vertical ±0x200;
- a 250 x 1500 x 250 mm box around the guard counts as seen ("bump",
  `FUN_00256C08`);
- line of sight against the level collision;
- result (+0x18E): 3 seen (inside d), 2 glimpse (d..1.5d), 1 blocked, 0 none.

## Suspicion meter: `FUN_00256488`

Meter at controller +0x274, 0..0x400: level 3 → +1 per frame; level 2 →
at least 1 (−1 per frame during an alert); otherwise −16 per frame unless
the tracking flag is set.

## Normal brain: `FUN_00227BC8`

16 states; transitions in `FUN_00227520` (stimulus bits at C+0x268) and
`FUN_00227430`:

- meter > 0 → investigate (state 6), which escalates when meter > 8;
- meter ≥ 2 or seen → discovery (state 8). Its sub-states come from the
  table at 0x3f0c20; sub 2 is the "!", sub 8 is aiming, which sets the meter
  to 0x400.

## Alert brain: `FUN_00229D30`

Seen → meter 0x400. The tracking flag (+0x348 & 0x40) expires 60 frames
after the last sighting (+0x33C).

Shooting (`FUN_00228710` / `FUN_00228F80`): aim for 21 frames, then fire
every 4 frames with a 1-in-3 chance to stop after each shot; reload after
31 shots.

Bullet: `FUN_0036D5B8(matrix, flags, 1, 0x19, 10, 20000, 1000, 0xf)`:
hit size 0x19, damage 10, range 20000 mm, speed 1000 mm per frame; aim
spread ±0x80 on two axes.

Damage: Snake's life is at player+0x782 (script Bs16:0xf2, maximum
Bs16:0xf4). `FUN_00289320` applies the damage accumulators (e.g.
DAT_001919f4) and revives Snake with an equipped ration: full life on Very
Easy, half otherwise.

## Evasion brain: `FUN_0022C670`

Its case 2 (`FUN_00238BF8`) is the discovery state again: seeing Snake
during evasion restarts discovery. The search pattern itself is not ported
yet; guards visit navigation nodes around the last known position instead.

## Manager: `FUN_00220818` / `FUN_00220430`

- M7 = max(M7 − 16, highest guard meter);
- infiltration/caution → alert when M7 ≥ 0x400;
- alert → evasion when M7 reaches 0; evasion lasts 0x4B0 frames;
- evasion → caution for `-h` frames (default 0xE10), then infiltration.

Phase is mirrored to Bs16:0x112 (0 infiltration, 1 alert, 2 evasion, 3
caution).

## Not yet ported

- the per-guard "!" length (from the action's motion);
- close-quarters sub-states, radio reports, reinforcements;
- noise, footprints and bodies as stimuli;
- the game's precomputed shortest-path matrices in the `.hzx` (paths are
  recomputed from the node links instead).
